## Installation of the R package library for the Analysis
All the application needed for the analysis were installed 

#Introduction 
This exploratory analysis case study is towards Capstome project requirement for Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. The case study involves a bikeshare company's data of its customer's trip details over a 12 month period (May 2023 - December 2023 and January 2024 - April 2024). 

## Dataset 
The dataset was downloaded from the link provided here: it is an historical trip data to analyze and identify trends. This datasets will enable us to answer the business questions. The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this license.) 

## Purpose
The purpose of this capsome project is to determine how casual riders annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently and to derive insights that will be use by the marketing  team to design a new marketing strategy on how to convert casual riders into annual members. And this insight will have to be backed up by compelling data and professional visualizations. Here I use R as programming language for data wrangling and visualization to answer the business question using the data analysis process :Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act

## About the company
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share off ering. Since then, the program has grown
to a fl eet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations
across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station
in the system anytime.

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to
broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships.
Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders.
Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profi table
than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers,
Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth.
Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes
there is a solid opportunity to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders
are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs

##Ask 
The goal is to answer this fundamental question on how do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently? 
With this question I will need to produce a report with the following deliverables: 
i.A clear statement of the business task 
ii.A description of all data sources used 
iii.Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data 
iv.A summary of your analysis 
v.Supporting visualizations and key findings 
vi.My top three recommendations based on your analysis

## Key Stakeholders
Cyclistic’s executive
The managers
Cyclistic’s finance analysts
The marketing team

# Recommendation
  
. There should be a marketing campaign stating the benefits of annual membership during the periods of the week when casual riders seem to be high, i.e., around Saturday and Sunday.

. The Advert should be placed at Streeter Dr & Grand Ave and Dusable Lake Shore Dr & Monroe St where their are pick in casual rider 

. There should be a general marketing campaign from May to September, which is the preferred period for bikers based on the data, for the benefit of becoming an annual rider.

. There should be incentives that will not eat into the gain to encourage casual riders to join Annaul riders.
